## Tools

### pcapMappr

Started as a simple python-script to find geoIP of pcap-traffic.
Now does a bit more, producing for example statistics and visualization from network packet capture

### NetNote

I needed a simple browser-based tool to inject notes into the network traffic.
Mostly used for notekeeping during testing of physical devices, allowing forming connection between user actions (registering a device via mobile app) and the collected network traffic.
